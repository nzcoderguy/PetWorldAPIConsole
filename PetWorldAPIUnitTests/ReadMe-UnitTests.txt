This is a straight forward MSUnitTest project - designed to test the parser built for this API. 

After some testing, it appears some of the data from the Petstore API is incomplete or broken data - so we need to parse every 'pet' that we process for looking at.

To run, right click on PetWorldAPIUnitTests Project Name, and click on "Run Tests".
