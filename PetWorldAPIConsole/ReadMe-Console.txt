This is a straight forward .NET Core Console project - designed to parse the results for this API. 

After some testing, it appears some of the data from the Petstore API is incomplete or broken data - so we need to parse every 'pet' that we process for looking at.

To run, right click on PetWorldAPIConsole Project Name, and check "Set as Startup Project", then hit F5 on your keyboard to trigger a build and execute.

The console application will appear and do its thing outputting some of the requirements for this test. It won't close until you hit return/enter.
